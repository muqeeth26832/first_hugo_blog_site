# MY first git hub hugo repo

This HUGO project is basic. Still was my first time using Hugo. 
It's the fastest static site generator.

Good to maintain blogs or content-based static sites.

Will sure learn more and make a better site.

## My experience

It was fun learning something new. 
It's easy for beginners but the file system in it seems a bit confusing.

## What I remember

1. Basic hugo terminal cmd's
2. If you don't want to make a custom site just use hugo themes you can git clone it into the themes folder
  - As you then just need to write content
  - You may need to get comfortable with the theme

4. If you want your own theme 
  - goto layout
  - make _deafaults then in side it list.html and single.html (also a baseof.html if you want) 
  - you can add your components to a new folder partials
  - add 404.html to layout
  - you can make a new folder for a particular type of content like categories and can make a single page for it

  - static is where you write css, js, also you  can add images
  - I didn't use the data folder but it's to store some .json . maybe ( you don't need a full database just use the data folder)

  - archetypes - it's used to make a base layout for all new md files you create

  - hugo.toml is your config file you can change the title add params, taxonomies

### note
*I am a beginner*
So it's my first impressions 
I just know basic html,css and js. 
(*I should revise them as I am forgetting them. Cause I didn't use them for a long time to make any projects*)
